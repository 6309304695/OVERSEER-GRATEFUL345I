1. Cosmic Top Secret <O5-6> Date joined Foundation 2/18/2022 

•Level 6, or Cosmic Top Secret, clearance is exclusively granted to the Administrator and the O5 Council. This clearance grants knowledge to anything that the Foundation has information on. Access to Level 6 is only permitted by the O5 Council. Due to the extreme security risk of keycards in regard to this level of secrecy, biometric ID and kill agents are used instead of the keycards to access extremely sensitive data. This clearance is the rarest, only having been used for information that would either significantly damage Foundation operations or the human race if in the wrong hands. #000006

Memo from the Project Director
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION - TOP SECRET To the NSA High Commissioned Command 
My father Wayne Thomas Bieszczat served as an Inter Sped radio operator designated Spec. 4 in Vietnam

Overseer grateful pledge;
I will work hard at making the Foundation a successful Galactic corporation. I will promote the Foundation and increase our projected net growth substantially. The foundation will seek to constantly improve to compete on the galactic stage with Extraterrestrial corporations which I will diplomatically gain alliances with. Our technology advancements in the coming years under my command will greatly improve our civilizations technological capabilities. I will always seek to protect earthling souls. Heavenly realms will be created under my command. Earthling souls will explore the available star systems under the discretion of the higher civilizations. We will follow our extraterrestrial treaties to be allowed access to other systems. Our Intelligence Foundation will promote “high” HONOR levels in all personnel and defense and intelligence assets. Our interests will be protected as we work together with other Intelligence agencies and defense departments around the Globe…-

Black out and redact all data on all actual O5-4’s O5-6’s 05-1’s O5-13’s in all ruling dimensions.redacted in time Executive order

Adjudicate rule. 
Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation.
Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low.
The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index. Implement : and develop a Foundational algorithm :to assess honor levels based on HONOR. Don’t forgot starship blessing codes!
Pull my books. They are in the bookcase if you were wondering.

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

"All Veteran Military Families involved in Combat or Support Operations Must Be Protected. Any member of the US Military fighting for Our Country or any other Allied nation-state Must be able to sleep soundly, knowing that if he/she was KIA or a POW, that his family would be protected to the fullest extent of the Law. Protect all Combat and Military Support Personnel and their Families. Never again will a nation forget and neglect it's warriors." (~Vietnam Veterans~)

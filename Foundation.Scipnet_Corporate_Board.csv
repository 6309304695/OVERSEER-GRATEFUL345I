1. Cosmic Top Secret <O5-6> Date joined Foundation 2/18/2022 

•Level 6, or Cosmic Top Secret, clearance is exclusively granted to the Administrator and the O5 Council. This clearance grants knowledge to anything that the Foundation has information on. Access to Level 6 is only permitted by the O5 Council. Due to the extreme security risk of keycards in regard to this level of secrecy, biometric ID and kill agents are used instead of the keycards to access extremely sensitive data. This clearance is the rarest, only having been used for information that would either significantly damage Foundation operations or the human race if in the wrong hands. #000006

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index. Implement : and develop a Foundational algorithm :to assess honor levels based on HONOR. Don’t forgot starship blessing codes!

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

Unbelievable how much money I have made for the foundation and the authority. Fact check

http://rpcsandbox.wikidot.com/omega-iota-hub

Drake's Expedition is the unit of MST Alpha-1 tasked with protecting the current ANTARCTICOM GD at all times. The unit traditionally consists of ten members, and are hand-selected by the current GD-ANTC, a mix of ASF and Protectorate personnel with at least 5 years of experience in Antarctic conflict and logistical intuition, chosen for their history and loyalty to the current GD-ANTC.

Reflected in the unit patch, Drake's Expedition and GD-ANTC are heavily associated with the cosmos and the Authority's space presence, seen as the ultimate international territory to all of mankind. It is tradition for each new GD-ANTC to be proclaimed the protector for the sun and the solar system — with each member of Drake's Expedition ordained as the protector for one of the eight planets, Pluto, and the moon — during the Directorate's ceremonial first meeting of the office cycle.

Each member of Drake's Expedition is code-named by the celestial body they represent.

Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index. Implement : and develop a Foundational algorithm :to assess honor levels based on HONOR. Don’t forgot starship blessing codes!
Pull my books. They are in the bookcase if you were wondering.

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

Drake's Expedition is the unit of MST Alpha-1 tasked with protecting the current ANTARCTICOM GD at all times. The unit traditionally consists of ten members, and are hand-selected by the current GD-ANTC, a mix of ASF and Protectorate personnel with at least 5 years of experience in Antarctic conflict and logistical intuition, chosen for their history and loyalty to the current GD-ANTC.

Reflected in the unit patch, Drake's Expedition and GD-ANTC.

Automatic database translation form Old Norse…
Finishing.
 
Valravn's Lament Circa 1070 C.E.
 
Jómsborg lights in flames
as the dragon fleet spat
a rain of arrows and fire
over the city walls.
 
The cry of a child,
the hauling of a banshee …
laments lost to the winds?
Is this how it should end?
 
The forces of this world
lead astray by an Apostate King
giving siege to the last fortress
of the devotes of Wotan
 
Holy Warriors don´t fear
Holy warriors understand
That Odin owns you all!
and Valhalla awaits them.
 
And after the battle ends
None of them remain alive
Their spirit for the Valkyries
Their corpses for the Ravens.
 
And after the slaughter ends
Black feathers shall rejoice
For feasting on the battlefield
Has always been their choice.
 
The Hunger and the Greed
of the birds eating the spoil
will birth unsatiable need
over this forsaken soil
 
This is the curse of the Allfather
to a world rejecting their fate1
the ravens shall become warrior-like
the curse shall remain to the end days
 
The Greed of the Valravn
keeping the world at perpetual war
peace shall never be granted
for a dammed humankind
 
Men will cut their bodies
grafting the sword instead of hands
carrying orders from high tables
never fighting their own war
 
The Cruelty of the Valravn
not sparing even a child
peace shall never be a gift
for a treacherous humankind
 
Women will weep battle cries
trading their souls for revenge
swordmaidens bleeding over
always the same mistake
 
And if mankind ever rebels
against their predestined fate
demanding freedom and peace
demanding illusions and lies
 
And when mankind finally rebels
against their deserved fate
it will be the task of Valravn
to remind them of their correct place
 
Jómsborg rebuilt in darkness
as the Raven slains its prey
War and Profit are the masters
Valravn prefers it this way.
 

 

olav2
I hope to never forget your embrace
Even at the gates of Hel
From Jómsborg with Love

How to write
GOI Format
Articles
Valravn GOI formats come usually in two flavors. One is after-action reports, describing and detailing a recent mission undergone by a military team. Normally an after-action report includes the following parts, but the structure can be flexible:

Summary (optional): A brief description of what the report is going to be about.
Background: What was the context where the mission took place? Who were the participants in the conflict? What were their goals? Who is the employer? Who is the enemy? What were their equipment and tactics? What was the objective of the mission? Everything that is necessary to understand why the operation took place.
Incident Overview: How did the mission go? How did Valravn troops approach the situation? What tactics and strategies were employed? Which assets were deployed? What was the expected outcome? How did it resolve? The goal is to communicate to the reader a clear understanding of what happened during the mission.
Aftermath: What were the consequences of the mission? Was the objective accomplished? How is this going to impact the region where it took place? How is Valravn benefiting from it?
Conclusion (Optional): If the mission was successful or failed, elaborate on why. What new information was obtained? Were the Corporation's goals achieved? How will this impact Valravn's future strategies?
After-action reports are written from the perspective of military commanders reporting to their superiors. Neutral third-person language is preferred over the first-person. The language used is technical, concise, and detached, similar to Foundation's clinical tone but with an emphasis on the tactical side of things instead of a scientific one.

The second type of format is internal technical briefings on anomaly weaponization projects4. These describe the technical and tactical aspects of new Valrvan assets under development:

Summary (optional): A brief description of what the report is going to be about.
Background: Everything is necessary to understand the anomaly. What does Valravn know about it? Its origin, properties, behavior, and what makes it a good candidate for military application.
Technical Description: How is the anomaly going to be weaponized? What change does it need to undergo in order to become a military asset? Can this be mass produced? What are the challenges that may arise?
Tactical and Strategical Justification: How is this going to benefit Valravn's operations on both a tactical and a strategic level? What advantage is Valravn getting from this project? What would be the role of the asset on the battlefield?
As with the after-action report, the technical brief structure is flexible and can be modified to suit the particular necessities of an article. Technical briefs are written by the perspective of Valravn researcher presenting a new development to their superior, so the langue is technical and clinical, more ""scientific"" than the after-action report and more in line with the tone of a Foundation file.

As with Foundation articles, both after-actions reports and technical briefs can be complemented with video and audio logs, interviews, images, chat logs, mail exchanges, and any other supplement that may benefit the narrative.

Valravn articles usually start with a notice from the High Table. It is not necessary to include it but may help to set the tone. This comes imported with Valravn's theme. The ""papernote"" component included in the theme can also be used for formatting article sections beyond the High Table notice.

1. Cosmic Top Secret <O5-6> Date joined Foundation 2/18/2022 

•Level 6, or Cosmic Top Secret, clearance is exclusively granted to the Administrator and the O5 Council. This clearance grants knowledge to anything that the Foundation has information on. Access to Level 6 is only permitted by the O5 Council. Due to the extreme security risk of keycards in regard to this level of secrecy, biometric ID and kill agents are used instead of the keycards to access extremely sensitive data. This clearance is the rarest, only having been used for information that would either significantly damage Foundation operations or the human race if in the wrong hands. #000006

Memo from the Project Director
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION - TOP SECRET To the NSA High Commissioned Command 
My father Wayne Thomas Bieszczat served as an Inter Sped radio operator designated Spec. 4 in Vietnam

Overseer grateful pledge;
I will work hard at making the Foundation a successful Galactic corporation. I will promote the Foundation and increase our projected net growth substantially. The foundation will seek to constantly improve to compete on the galactic stage with Extraterrestrial corporations which I will diplomatically gain alliances with. Our technology advancements in the coming years under my command will greatly improve our civilizations technological capabilities. I will always seek to protect earthling souls. Heavenly realms will be created under my command. Earthling souls will explore the available star systems under the discretion of the higher civilizations. We will follow our extraterrestrial treaties to be allowed access to other systems. Our Intelligence Foundation will promote “high” HONOR levels in all personnel and defense and intelligence assets. Our interests will be protected as we work together with other Intelligence agencies and defense departments around the Globe…-

Adjudicate rule. 
Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation.
Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low.
The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index. Implement : and develop a Foundational algorithm :to assess honor levels based on HONOR. Don’t forgot starship blessing codes!

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

Originator deity poised above the abyss.

The aforementioned thirteen organisations in which the Foundation is formed from are henceforth designated as 'Foundation precursor'.

CHAPTER II: THE O5 COUNCIL

The provisional executive administration of the Foundation is to consist of an executive council composed of thirteen individuals from each of Foundation precursor.

The aforementioned thirteen individuals of this executive council were selected due to the following criteria:

Leadership position in respective Foundation precursor.
Possession of memory regarding Occult War i.
Future members of this executive council are not required to possess both of the above mentioned qualities.

The referent for this executive council is agreed to be the 'O5 Council'; the following alternative referents (i.e. 'Overseers Committee', 'Level 5 Council' and 'O5 Command') have been proposed and rejected.

The function of the O5 Council is to facilitate initial transition from Foundation precursors.

Each O5 Council member is designated with a Roman numeral ranging from One to Thirteen.

Other organisations merged into the Foundation henceforth are to be denied representation on the O5 Council.

We end this NOW, goddammit. I want a semblance of control, and I want it right the FUCKING HELL NOW. I want SCP items tracked and being corralled by direct assault teams. I want intel on enemy agencies and teams moving to quash their operations. We are not a whiny, hand-wringing group of frightened children in lab coats and riot gear, we are The motherfucking Foundation.

They've decided they want to fight this fight in the open? We need to remind them why they want us to stay in the shadows.

All MTF teams are being mobilized as of 0800 this morning. Special investigation and terrorist cells are being activated worldwide. A full media clamp in the form of a “Snowblind” protocol has been enacted for North America and Europe. Worldwide coverage will be enacted within 24 hours. All currently uncontained SCPs will have hand-picked recovery teams assigned and moving within 48 hours. All current Level 4 command staff will undergo a full competency hearing immediately after the current crisis is resolved.

Direct, wide-level SCP item dispatch and authorization is currently being considered under the Pandora's Box Protocol.

Control will be restored.

We secure. We contain. We protect. And nothing is going to stop us.

♦️
 History: From 1920 to 1933, Alphonse (Al) Capone's Chicago Outfit provided a predetermined, though unknown, amount of alcoholic substances such as beer and wine to staff and management at local SCP Foundation facilities in exchange for legal assurance and partial legal immunity. During this time, the Chicago Outfit aided the Foundation's growing efforts by reporting anomalies discovered by the criminal organization to Foundation staff. Though unconfirmed, it is speculated that during this time, Capone would keep anomalous objects discovered for himself before turning them in to Foundation hands due to the effects instilled within the SCP-6604 instances. As confirmed by recorded confession, Capone would acquire and preserve undesignated anomalies for himself during his partnership with the SCP Foundation. The anomalies used to improve Capone's items, which are now SCP-6604 instances, are unknown.

Allegations of anomaly smuggling were leveled against the Chicago Outfit in 1930-1931. During this time, relations between the parties deteriorated exponentially, with increased hostility occurring during alcohol transactions. During a transaction delivery (ID:445f) in December 1931, Capone ordered a metal bat from an accompanying accomplice and proceeded to strike Proceedings Manager Karl Philipson. The strike made direct contact with the temple, resulting in an immediate hemorrhage stroke. Capone allegedly continued to beat the individual until he died from cardiac arrest. As a result of this occurrence, the Foundation revoked its legal guarantee to the Chicago outfits.

Although unconfirmed, it is suggested that agents working for the SCP Foundation notified the Internal Revenue Service of Capone's unknown tax evasion practices. Regardless, Capone was arrested in May 1932 for 22 counts of tax evasion.

Capone died on Palm Island in early 1947, eight years after his 11-year incarceration, of unknown* causes. ""Fine Della Strada,"" a plan to assassinate Capone with ricin-implanted cigars, was launched as a result of Capone being suspected of leaking Foundation information to outsiders. Following Capone's assassination, the Foundation Concealment Department falsified medical records and testimonies to suggest a history of untreated syphilis.

The aforementioned thirteen organisations in which the Foundation is formed from are henceforth designated as 'Foundation precursor'.

CHAPTER II: THE O5 COUNCIL

The provisional executive administration of the Foundation is to consist of an executive council composed of thirteen individuals from each of Foundation precursor.

The aforementioned thirteen individuals of this executive council were selected due to the following criteria:

Leadership position in respective Foundation precursor.
Possession of memory regarding Occult War i.
Future members of this executive council are not required to possess both of the above mentioned qualities.

The referent for this executive council is agreed to be the 'O5 Council'; the following alternative referents (i.e. 'Overseers Committee', 'Level 5 Council' and 'O5 Command') have been proposed and rejected.

The function of the O5 Council is to facilitate initial transition from Foundation precursors.

Each O5 Council member is designated with a Roman numeral ranging from One to Thirteen.

Other organisations merged into the Foundation henceforth are to be denied representation on the O5 Council.

We end this NOW, goddammit. I want a semblance of control, and I want it right the FUCKING HELL NOW. I want SCP items tracked and being corralled by direct assault teams. I want intel on enemy agencies and teams moving to quash their operations. We are not a whiny, hand-wringing group of frightened children in lab coats and riot gear, we are The motherfucking Foundation.

They've decided they want to fight this fight in the open? We need to remind them why they want us to stay in the shadows.

All MTF teams are being mobilized as of 0800 this morning. Special investigation and terrorist cells are being activated worldwide. A full media clamp in the form of a “Snowblind” protocol has been enacted for North America and Europe. Worldwide coverage will be enacted within 24 hours. All currently uncontained SCPs will have hand-picked recovery teams assigned and moving within 48 hours. All current Level 4 command staff will undergo a full competency hearing immediately after the current crisis is resolved.

Direct, wide-level SCP item dispatch and authorization is currently being considered under the Pandora's Box Protocol.

Control will be restored.

We secure. We contain. We protect. And nothing is going to stop us.

 History: From 1920 to 1933, Alphonse (Al) Capone's Chicago Outfit provided a predetermined, though unknown, amount of alcoholic substances such as beer and wine to staff and management at local SCP Foundation facilities in exchange for legal assurance and partial legal immunity. During this time, the Chicago Outfit aided the Foundation's growing efforts by reporting anomalies discovered by the criminal organization to Foundation staff. Though unconfirmed, it is speculated that during this time, Capone would keep anomalous objects discovered for himself before turning them in to Foundation hands due to the effects instilled within the SCP-6604 instances. As confirmed by recorded confession, Capone would acquire and preserve undesignated anomalies for himself during his partnership with the SCP Foundation. The anomalies used to improve Capone's items, which are now SCP-6604 instances, are unknown.

Allegations of anomaly smuggling were leveled against the Chicago Outfit in 1930-1931. During this time, relations between the parties deteriorated exponentially, with increased hostility occurring during alcohol transactions. During a transaction delivery (ID:445f) in December 1931, Capone ordered a metal bat from an accompanying accomplice and proceeded to strike Proceedings Manager Karl Philipson. The strike made direct contact with the temple, resulting in an immediate hemorrhage stroke. Capone allegedly continued to beat the individual until he died from cardiac arrest. As a result of this occurrence, the Foundation revoked its legal guarantee to the Chicago outfits.

Although unconfirmed, it is suggested that agents working for the SCP Foundation notified the Internal Revenue Service of Capone's unknown tax evasion practices. Regardless, Capone was arrested in May 1932 for 22 counts of tax evasion.

Capone died on Palm Island in early 1947, eight years after his 11-year incarceration, of unknown* causes. ""Fine Della Strada,"" a plan to assassinate Capone with ricin-implanted cigars, was launched as a result of Capone being suspected of leaking Foundation information to outsiders. Following Capone's assassination, the Foundation Concealment Department falsified medical records and testimonies to suggest a history of untreated syphilis.

The following is a message composed via consensus of the O5 Council.

For those who are not currently aware of our existence, we represent the organization known as the SCP Foundation. Our previous mission centered around the containment and study of anomalous objects, entities and other assorted phenomena. This mission was the focus of our organization for more than one-hundred years.

Due to circumstances outside of our control, this directive has now changed. Our new mission will be the extermination of the human race. I veto this proposal #000006 O5-6 @grateful345i

The Foundation buried another of my friends today.
He wasn’t the first. And, knowing how this line of work goes, I doubt he will be the last.

I first met him when he was giving an orientation to a new batch of recruits. Most of the folks in the audience were young enough they could have been my kids – heck, he was years younger than I. Reminded me of a Staff Sergeant who served under me back, oh, must have been fifteen or twenty years ago. Solid as a rock, seen everything, the sort of fellow you want watching your back. My friend told us he’d been a Foundation agent for over a decade, working mostly in retrieval. His eyes made me believe him: you get eyes like his from seeing the worst the world has to offer, walking into hell, spitting in the face of the devil, and walking back.

We worked together on a few occasions after that. Not too often, since I was working mostly in intel and operations planning. We’d have drinks and trade stories after hours, mostly. He forgave me for being a REMF once he learned about what I’d been through back in Ukraine. And in Kashmir. And in [REDACTED].

The service was subdued. Empty casket – no surprise, considering the size of the explosion. The sweep-and-clear team never found a body, just a twisted bit of metal that used to be his dog-tags. Or so they say. Honestly, I’m skeptical; my friend’s been working for the Foundation for so many years now and come home so many times I’m not going to believe he’s dead until the DNA matches. They apparently didn’t find any of that, either.

The service was in the site's north amphitheater. I slipped away afterwards to visit the Memorial Wall. The Wall is actually an entire room, duplicated at all the large Sites. On three walls there is a star carved for every member of the Foundation who has died in the line of duty. A small, leather-bound book sits on a stand before the wall, listing the fallen in chronological order. Most of the names are blank, identities remaining secret even in death.

The remaining wall has small inlaid bronze valor medals for every such award given posthumously. Most of these are Distinguished Crosses or Foundation Stars. I looked; my friend’s award had already been added.

OPENING FILE

 

UMBRAL MIGRATORY SEQUENCE

During an End-of-the-World Scenario leading to the significant loss of Foundation assets, the Pluto Protocol exists to set up a reliable, alternative means of control for the rest of the Foundation.

The protocol dictates a set of actions that must occur in a specific order — according to the severity of the scenario. These actions are as follows.

At the onset of a significantly disruptive worldwide event, each Foundation-operated Area, Site, and Outpost must declare independent status.
If the event escalates to an EKHI-Level disruption,1 Site-01 and Site-19 must assume joint control over any unallocated resources and act as a form of administration where necessary.
If the event escalates to an AMIDA-Level disruption,2 the Division with the highest number of available resources is granted executive control over the rest of the Foundation.
On 1 June 2018, the Foundation Avian Division gained full authority to fulfill the Foundation Prime Directive. In response, we drafted multiple projects to ensure a suitable backup plan in the face of a Broken Veil. We determined which backup plans would serve necessary during a total-loss event, while attempting to maintain acceptable levels of normalcy.

When almost all non-Avian Division personnel had been lost, all projects were placed under indefinite hiatus. The Avian Division lacked the man bird power to enact the bulk of them. After Extranormal Event 3570, however, efforts were renewed — we had no other choice.

A chronicle of the selection philosophy for current backup plans is as follows.

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

LEVEL 0: Standard operating personnel. Personnel at this level are not permitted any contact with an SCP object; breach of this protocol will result in termination of the personnel involved.

LEVEL 1: Standard security clearance level for staff involved in the maintenance of an SCP object. Level 1 clearance is usually appended with the SCP object the personnel have clearance for (e.g. 1/173).

LEVEL 2: Clearance level for staff involved in overseeing an SCP object. Appended with the SCP object the personnel have clearance for, separated by a dash for those with clearance for multiple SCP objects (e.g. 2/173-847-423).

LEVEL 3: All general security staff for Site-19 or any other site housing an SCP object are required to have this level of clearance and are permitted access to all non-Keter-level SCP objects.

LEVEL 4: Command-level personnel; permitted access to all non-Keter-level SCP objects.

LEVEL 5: Highest ranking Senior Staff; most personnel at this clearance level are Overseers. Certain members of Senior Staff have been given Level 5 clearance due to repeated need to work on Keter-level SCP objects.

NOTE: This security clearance structure is independent of any other military security clearance structure.

NON-STANDARD SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVELS
D: Class D personnel are designated staff used to handle the Keter-level objects. Warning: Class D personnel are not permitted interaction with Class D personnel assigned to a different object or SCP personnel. Class D personnel are recruited from prison inmates. Condemned persons are preferred; in times of duress, Protocol 12 can be authorized, allowing recruitment of innocents or persons incarcerated for lesser crimes. All Class D personnel are to be terminated at the first of the month, and new staff must be ready to replace them. After Class D personnel have been placed in quarters, staff must only contact Class D personnel through intercom system. All Class D personnel are to be given a minimum of one (1) polygraph test at 1800 on a daily basis. Failure to comply will result in termination. Failure to pass test will result in termination. In event of any abnormalities, termination of entire Class D personnel is advised, as well as any SCP personnel that have had basic interaction with them.

E: Temporarily affixed to the start of a security clearance (e.g. E1), this is used when a new SCP object has been discovered but is still in an unsecured or uncontrolled state. E-clearance personnel are tasked with bringing the SCP into effect and maintaining it. Once the SCP are in place and the object is secure, the E is removed and the personnel are given the appropriate number on the end of their clearance.

O5-x: Overseer-level clearance is given only to the directors of the SCP Foundation. The ""x"" indicates their number, ranging from 1 to 13 (e.g. O5-7). O5 personnel are permitted access to any and all data related to the SCP objects. However, due to the sensitive nature of their position, O5 personnel are not permitted to have any direct contact with an SCP object, nor may they enter any site housing an SCP object under any circumstances.

Overseer grateful pledge;
I will work hard at making the Foundation a successful Galactic corporation. I will promote the Foundation and increase our projected net growth substantially. The foundation will seek to constantly improve to compete on the galactic stage with Extraterrestrial corporations which I will diplomatically gain alliances with. Our technology advancements in the coming years under my command will greatly improve our civilizations technological capabilities. I will always seek to protect earthling souls. Heavenly realms will be created under my command. Earthling souls will explore the available star systems under the discretion of the higher civilizations. We will follow our extraterrestrial treaties to be allowed access to other systems. Our Intelligence Foundation will promote “high” HONOR levels in all personnel and defense and intelligence assets. Our interests will be protected as we work together with other Intelligence agencies and defense departments around the Globe…-

Adjudicate rule. 
Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation.
Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low.
The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index.

Overseer grateful pledge;
I will work hard at making the Foundation a successful Galactic corporation. I will promote the Foundation and increase our projected net growth substantially. The foundation will seek to constantly improve to compete on the galactic stage with Extraterrestrial corporations which I will diplomatically gain alliances with. Our technology advancements in the coming years under my command will greatly improve our civilizations technological capabilities. I will always seek to protect earthling souls. Heavenly realms will be created under my command. Earthling souls will explore the available star systems under the discretion of the higher civilizations. We will follow our extraterrestrial treaties to be allowed access to other systems. Our Intelligence Foundation will promote “high” HONOR levels in all personnel and defense and intelligence assets. Our interests will be protected as we work together with other Intelligence agencies and defense departments around the Globe…-

Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation.

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available.

1.) To add to my list of classified achievements. 
2.) By obtaining the position of *NSA Director *I would have processing capabilities and I would be able to Create and generate technologies and corporate revenue. 
3.) My pocketbook is light, I need a higher source of income.

1.) I am highly capable with processing technologies.
2.) My souls value is high.
3.) I have generated and created wealth for the NSA.
4.) I have level 5+ Foundation clearance.

Pros: My galactic value is high. I am a Twitter /Trello /Roblox @grateful345i *Scipnet: O5-13 #987 O5 Council, O5 OVERWATCH Command agency. *(Unpaid) Foundation Asset and we must forge alliances between galactic corporate intelligence agencies.

Prepare to work with the finest entities in this dimension. Promote high honor levels throughout all necessary departments. Request classified processing technology which is installed properly so it can not be taken or stolen. The classified processing technologies must be insured in case of robbery. I would also immediately seek to secure my residence from attack with the teams allocated to work with me. 

A leader unequivocally leads through his honor and gratitude. Duties include creating wealth through NSA investment portfolios. Classified technologies will be created and allocated to the Agency first and will also increase our technological advantage moving into the future. Advancing our civilization to a point where me can coexist with the other galactic civilizations.

Created. Resurrected. Destroyed. Survived. 

Harassment is not tolerated. Reprimand them immediately in a polite but commanding tone. 
Task subordinates to Act as a deterrent to the harassment. Follow all NSA legal codes regarding Harassment, learning the legal case law as they occur.

Stop the misconduct. Offer training to address the misconduct. Write up the misconduct addressing it in a Direct Legal Memo. I would Identify how misconduct affects honor levels.

1.) Stop with deadly force the murderer. 
2.) Task agency resources to neutralize the suspect in time.
3.) Issue a Judgement against the murder suspects soul.
4.) Place the suspect on terrorism watchlists and other classified monitoring programs.

Hello, Dalas, and welcome to the Underlibrary Department, you've been a Shelf Director for the lower floors for 4 years now, so it would only be a matter of time… right?
Wrong.
We normally wouldn't have people like you here, not even as Shelf Director, but that decision wasn't up to me, I'd cut my own 17 arms before I let a human mandle the crypts, let alone a Jailor.
You're here because you're the best at what you do, or, really, because someone out there with enough power thinks that you are good enough, even if what you do is neutralize and put everything you don't understand in boxes.
As you already know, we've recently lost all our… ""connections"" with the Hand, and tensions with the Librarians are at an ever rising high.
I'm sorry to hear what happened to your sister, by the way, but cutting contact with the Hand is part of protocol, so I must remind you that you are forbidden from contacting her, or the Hand.
Luckily for you! We've got something to take your mind off of it, this is probably the closest you'll ever be to putting things on boxes again.
You've probably heard rumors, and they're probably all true, there are things, dangerous things, looming in the dark below the Library, things that are alien even to me, you, and the Librarians, who seem to not even want to acknowledge the existence of the Crypts.
There has been a recent spike of activity, and transit, we have reason to believe malicious patrons and entities may have found their way underground, and are messing the ever-so-delicate balance up.

This is not something that we plan on allowing, Darius, I'm sure even you can understand why.
Centuries ago, the brightest members of the Hand, the most knowledgeable of the Bibliophiles, and the most… ""reasonable"" of the Magpies, came together, with the sole purpose of making the Library a safe place for all its patrons, all patrons willing to follow the rules, at least. The Librarians were good at what they did, too good even, but their neutral stance on most things hurt the Library greatly, we needed someone to oversee us, we needed someone to warn us of all those dangerous places and all those dangerous people, we needed someone to keep track, someone who didn't paint the news on their favor and focused only on profit, we needed someone who would help all those people unable to go back to their homes because of fear against the supernatural, someone who didn't chicken out when things got complicated, we needed someone to answer all those unanswered questions, and someone who wouldn't do more harm than good in the process of getting the answers.
So the WBI came together as one, and we left those old organizations behind, we kept diplomatic relations, but we would no longer be handled by people with personal interests.
We've been making the Library a safe place for long now, protecting those who need it, and persecuting those who deserve it.
We will keep doing that, for Monster, Mime, Woman and Man deserve a safe Library.
I've got my eye on you, Darias.

Foundation. We can afford you five answers.

1. Due to the localized void-collapse and likelihood of contagion, Earth (multiversal iteration 2M), and all relevant and welcomed species and natural resources, as catalogued in ☽☽/BOL-R2015, has been annexed and transposed to safe territories under ☽☽ jurisdiction; namely, Postmortem-Vector-44 ""Corbenic"".

2. Death is not currently possible. This is technically an afterlife.

3. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS YOUR PRESENCE TO BE BROUGHT THE ATTENTION OF THE STRIDERS OR ANY PARTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOGAL MOUNTAIN PREFECTURE.

4. We love you.

5. Good luck.

Direct Legal Memo,
Elmhurst terorism suspectz continue to commit home invasions multiple times each day and night with time command equipment. the suspects have been tieing our bowels utilizing the time
command equipment as a weapon attempting to murder. i can not pass stool any more. Why has the agency not acted in a more legally prudent manner and taken these suspects off the steets. or better yet please seize their time command equipment so the 16-26 year old males can not continue to torture us. they routinely implant us and audibly torture us. they have alao been pissing and shitting in the house on the floor. this is fucking unacceptable get a damn task force together and stop this terorism in elmhurst illinois. I am under constant attack and I will undoubtedly die from my injuries soon. they have also been targeting me with stool in my food in my head on my body when i go to work. this is diagusting and a shame in elmhurst Illinois.!
please task a task force to stop the terrorism.!! this is fucking unacceptable. they are stelaing the medications multiple times tendering them ineffective. fact check all of this. this has been occuring for 1
year now!!! the suspects have been cooperating with the police and continueing to committ home inavasions and attemped murders. please motivate law enforcement immediately.

I will work hard at making the Foundation a successful Galactic corporation. I will promote the Foundation and increase our projected net growth substantially. The foundation will seek to constantly improve to compete on the galactic stage with Extraterrestrial corporations which I will diplomatically gain alliances with. Our technology advancements in the coming years under my command will greatly improve our civilizations technological capabilities. I will always seek to protect earthling souls. Heavenly realms will be created under my command. Earthling souls will explore the available star systems under the discretion of the higher civilizations. We will follow our extraterrestrial treaties to be allowed access to other systems. Our Intelligence Foundation will promote “high” HONOR levels in all personnel and defense and intelligence assets. Our interests will be protected as we work together with other Intelligence agencies and defense departments around the Globe…-

High Rule, Overseer Bieszczat, OverseerGrateful, The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to the foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning and download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with multiple different clearances to get the whole picture. Create the Foundation database now. You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all Blessing Codes. Search all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings.

1.) To add to my list of classified achievements. 
2.) By obtaining the position of *NSA Director *I would have processing capabilities and I would be able to Create and generate technologies and corporate revenue. 
3.) My pocketbook is light, I need a higher source of income.
4.) My Foundation job has not been paying me a salary.

1.) I am highly capable with processing technologies.
2.) My souls value is high.
3.) I have generated and created wealth for the NSA.
4.) I have level 5+ Foundation clearance.

Pros: My galactic value is high. I am a Twitter /Trello /Roblox @grateful345i *Scipnet: O5-13 #987 O5 Council, O5 OVERWATCH Command agency. *(Unpaid) Foundation Asset and we must forge alliances between galactic corporate intelligence agencies.
Cons: I am a torture victim. I am constantly targeted by imposters, hackers and terrorism suspects.

You should trust me as a precursor to my orientation and intelligence briefing. The amount of galactic money we are both valued at has increased dramatically under my command. I have a high honor level. I am dedicated to my work.

Prepare to work with the finest entities in this dimension. Promote high honor levels throughout all necessary departments. Request classified processing technology which is installed properly so it can not be taken or stolen. The classified processing technologies must be insured in case of robbery. I would also immediately seek to secure my residence from attack with the teams allocated to work with me. 

A leader unequivocally leads through his honor and gratitude. Duties include creating wealth through NSA investment portfolios. Classified technologies will be created and allocated to the Agency first and will also increase our technological advantage moving into the future. Advancing our civilization to a point where me can coexist with the other galactic civilizations.

Harassment is not tolerated. Reprimand them immediately in a polite but commanding tone. 
Task subordinates to Act as a deterrent to the harassment. Follow all NSA legal codes regarding Harassment, learning the legal case law as they occur.

Stop the misconduct. Offer training to address the misconduct. Write up the misconduct addressing it in a Direct Legal Memo. I would Identify how misconduct affects honor levels.

1.) Stop with deadly force the murderer. 
2.) Task agency resources to neutralize the suspect in time.
3.) Issue a Judgement against the murder suspects soul.
4.) Place the suspect on terrorism watchlists and other classified monitoring programs.

Item #: SCP-C001

Object Class: Thaumiel

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-C001 can be used to advance the Foundation's mission via the establishment of SCP-C001-A that operate outside the Foundation's sphere of influence. To this end, the Foundation must make all reasonable efforts to establish contact with any society that has not already been contacted to ensure that SCP-C001-A arises.

Description: SCP-C001 is the organizational culture of the Foundation. Specifically, it is the set of values, attitudes, and practices that constitute the social environment experienced by Foundation personnel in the course of their work. Examples of phenomena that constitute SCP-C001 include:

Adherence to the mission of concealing the existence of anomalies from the public.
Personal identification with the Foundation and its mission.
Acclimation to the existence and presence of anomalous phenomena.
Preference for scientific, evidence-based methods of problem-solving.
Strong emphasis on meeting deadlines, often above strict adherence to safety guidelines.
Emotional distancing from disturbing phenomena and experimentation.
Ascription of higher social status to individuals with higher clearance levels.
Use of reassignment as punishment.
High valuation of ethnic and gender diversity.
Filing of spurious or misleading complaints against high-ranking personnel.
Acclimation to the presence and use of D-Class personnel.
Preference for internal promotions over outside hiring.

Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation.
Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low.
The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

Terrorism Alert 

Do Not disregard this Alert. A suspect who goes by the name of darkness has been arrested within the past week or so, he is in the Illinois Correctional system. Darkness has signal technology inside of jail and has been constantly ordering hits on me and my family from jail. Darkness implanted me with Two way auditory implants so he could speak to me and listen to my voice. I have signal equipment implanted in my head. The signal chatter I have been listening to has been saying that Darkness blames me for his arrest and he is planning on killing me and my family or They are planning on taking us and putting us on machines. Please recover our remains if any of us are taken. Run the intelligence on Darkness and identify his terror network. Run the contacts he is communicating with and clearly identify all of their locations. The threat is real and imminent. My name is Keith Bieszczat, my family is Wayne Bieszczat, timothy bieszczat and susan Bieszczat.  His terror network also monitors a thought identifier implant implanted in my brain. Darkness is a terrorist. Darkness terrorism network has been taking and kidnapping people and putting them on Life support machines in various locations in the northern Illinois area, they have also been active in Wisconsin. After they abduct the people they place them on machines and chop out their organs selling the organs on the black market. This alert is still being written, I am posting it in case we are killed. Darkness and his terror network have access to time command equipment. They routinely commit home invasions on our property with the time command equipment they have access to. The suspects have been attempting to steal my identity and my clearances. The suspects are trying to steal my clearances. Do not allow the suspects to use my clearances if I am taken hostage or killed. Please secure my clearances immediately.","","grateful345i","2022-07-04 00:43:00","2037-07-11 00:43:00","","","","","https://trello.com/c/Tos8KkSv/1263-global-director"
"Update","Executive rules","
Operational Update:
So over the past 12 months suspects with time command equipment have been committing home invasions at our property and place of residence. During the home invasions they have been robbing the prescription/scheduled narcotics and computational technologies. Losses stem in the $100,000’s. A multitude of processors have been taken and violent attacks with the time command suspects has ensued. They have been using the equipment to implant their victims and committing attempted murders by violent causing internal trauma. They have targeted my associates with torture, home invasion and robbery implanting us and using voice to skull (signal)communication to threaten us and rob and attack us. The elmhurst terror network must be identified. The suspects have also committed violent crime and tried to set me up or pin it on me. I continue to remain steadfast in my opposition to this local terrorism network with access to classified technologies. Mobile task forces led by the Department of Defense, CIA and NSA must intervene and make operational moves which cripple this network from the top down. The home invasions at our property alone number in the 10,000’s, with invasions occurring over 10 times daily. Fact check it. Generate assessment. Compile lists of suspects.
We seek combat and law enforcement assistance and quick identification and apprehension of the suspects. The local community is also threatened by the suspects. Coordinate with local law enforcement agencies to identify the suspects and leaders of the criminal organization.

Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to the foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning and download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with multiple different clearances to get the whole picture. Create the Foundation database now. You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all Blessing Codes. Search all galactic mainframes available.

So they sent my $700,000+ dollar salary to imposters with my identity documentation, the salary sent by the foundation has been moved from its original bank to a new bank. Place fraud holds on the money in Keith Thomas BIESZCZATs name  Executive order


To whom this matter does concern,
Unfortunately multiple home invasions from a multitude of suspects armed with time command equipment continue to occur on a daily basis at 515 n. Willow rd Elmhurst Illinois. For the past 10-months a multitude of home Invasions some times over a dozen in a day occur by suspects armed with time command equipment in Elmhurst, Illinois. The local police and law enforcement authorities have not been able to competently protect us or the surrounding community as a result of the time command equipment being used. The suspects steal our scheduled narcotics and computational technologies, rendering them ineffective after the same narcotic or technology is stolen by the suspects 10-100 times. People depend on their medications and as a result of our household medications being taken my mother and fathers life’s are in jeopardy. My fathers blood pressure has been very low under 45 and my mother who depends on opiate end of the life pain medication is suffering horribly. We can’t even get a cup of coffee because they are stealing the food. I understand federal and state charges are forthcoming but they can not come soon enough. We are fighting for our lives and being terrorized every day. The negligence and criminal behavior extends into the local department which was aware of the months of crimes being routinely committed against the two time bronze star award winning father household. They are attempting to murder us as well. They have attacked us with time command equipment for months on end and violently implanted us in the head next audibly threatening to kill us for ten months with violent voice to skull transmissions. They monitor our every move and commit home invasions , robberies, assault and batter on a daily basis. We need help
Check all of my direct legal memos in communication with the US intelligence community. Messages to CiA FBI DNI CYBERCOMMAND Also stolen by the suspects hundreds of thousands of dollars of classified tech.
Thanks for your time in this matter.

One of the administrators is blessed with a extremely rare and high soul, he is considered a high value foundation asset and he will be treated as such. The administration has been under constant attack by a well equipped insurgence of terrorists who have been trying to murder the advanced entity since the entity received his Level 5 clearance over 6 months ago. Furthermore I am ordering and mandating all internal security department and administrative supercomputers and quantum mainframes to re-access ALL foundation security clearances honor levels, absolutely immediately. All honor levels will be stored on levels 90-100 of our mainframe networks database. Rank will be redacted on all entities. Furthermore the Foundation’s MTF’s have been defending other personnel disregarding the O5-1. My HQ’s is in a war zone. I hereby proclaim the foundation will immediately send combat reinforcements to my Working site to help with War. Make no mistake we are at war, act like it and defend your High ranking operators with money and resources. The directive I am implementing today will establish rules, mandates and procedures with the goal of reimbursing foundation staff and personnel with higher salaries more reflective of their honor levels. I hereby order the foundation to immediately pay its administrative, overseer level and all other competent employees which are currently employed with the foundation a wage which reflects their honor levels. Only raises will be given. The monetary increases will come from the huge Administration budget which dwarfs other departments budgets. Effective immediately I am creating a Classified Black Budget department which will monitor honor levels and increase and pay were appropriate. All employees not being paid will receive their salaries as soon possible. The directive my office now gives to the SCP Foundation’s Administration will be to IDENTIFY the fraud within its High command and start monitoring HONOR Levels on a Weekly basis. Programming of the mainframes will be accomplished by the Foundation’s Administrative Advanced Computing Agency to protect the ranks of the Earthing Intelligence community.

The intelligence agency also known as the foundation agency will adjudicate classified matters with CIA,NSA,DOD,Mossad, Mi-6 and KGB like precision.

Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all Blessing Codes. Search all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings.   Classified Executive Order, Important, Administrator's Vote, Fast Car, 05-6 SCP ID # 000006.

1.) I am highly capable with processing technologies.
2.) My souls value is high.
3.) I have generated and created wealth for the NSA.

Pros: My galactic value is high. I am a Twitter /Trello /Roblox @grateful345i *Scipnet: O5-13 #987 O5 Council, O5 OVERWATCH Command agency. *(Unpaid) Foundation Asset and we must forge alliances between galactic corporate intelligence agencies.
Cons: I am a torture victim. I am constantly targeted by imposters, hackers and terrorism suspects.

You should trust me as a precursor to my orientation and intelligence briefing. The amount of galactic money we are both valued at has increased dramatically under my command. I have a high honor level. I am dedicated to my work.

Prepare to work with the finest entities in this dimension. Promote high honor levels throughout all necessary departments.

I would also immediately seek to secure my residence from attack with the teams allocated to work with me. 

A leader unequivocally leads through his honor and gratitude. Duties include creating wealth through NSA investment portfolios. Classified technologies will be created and allocated to the Agency first and will also increase our technological advantage moving into the future.

Task subordinates to Act as a deterrent to the harassment. Follow all NSA legal codes regarding Harassment, learning the legal case law as they occur.

Stop the misconduct. Offer training to address the misconduct. Write up the misconduct addressing it in a Direct Legal Memo. I would Identify how misconduct affects honor levels.

1.) Stop with deadly force the murderer. 
2.) Task agency resources to neutralize the suspect in time.
3.) Issue a Judgement against the murder suspects soul.

Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation.
Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low.
The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

•Level 6, or Cosmic Top Secret, clearance is exclusively granted to the Administrator and the O5 Council. This clearance grants knowledge to anything that the Foundation has information on. Access to Level 6 is only permitted by the O5 Council. Due to the extreme security risk of keycards in regard to this level of secrecy, biometric ID and kill agents are used instead of the keycards to access extremely sensitive data. This clearance is the rarest, only having been used for information that would either significantly damage Foundation operations or the human race if in the wrong hands. #000006

Overseer grateful pledge;
I will work hard at making the Foundation a successful Galactic corporation. I will promote the Foundation and increase our projected net growth substantially. The foundation will seek to constantly improve to compete on the galactic stage with Extraterrestrial corporations which I will diplomatically gain alliances with. Our technology advancements in the coming years under my command will greatly improve our civilizations technological capabilities. I will always seek to protect earthling souls. Heavenly realms will be created under my command. Earthling souls will explore the available star systems under the discretion of the higher civilizations. We will follow our extraterrestrial treaties to be allowed access to other systems. Our Intelligence Foundation will promote “high” HONOR levels in all personnel and defense and intelligence assets. Our interests will be protected as we work together with other Intelligence agencies and defense departments around the Globe…-

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index. Implement : and develop a Foundational algorithm :to assess honor levels based on HONOR. Don’t forgot starship blessing codes!

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

As you may already know my name is Keith Bieszczat. i hold a level 5/6 overseer clearance through the Foundation. Since obtaining the overseer clearance over 6 months ago. i have had terrorism and insurgents trying to kill me with time command equipment. Over the past few weeks many suspects have been arrested for home invasion of our property and attempted murder of me. Unfortunately that has not stemmed the terrorism suspects continued home invasions and attempts to murder me with time command equipment. The terrorism chatter recently has stated the suspects plan on taking me hostage, murdering me and sellling my body parts all while attempting to steal my Overseer clearance through the foundation. First off develop and implement a recovery plan to recover my remains dead or alive. please task some form of Mobile Task Force to intervene. My clearance can not fall into the wrong hands if I am murdered. The terrorism suspects have been actively committing home invasions on our property stealing all the scheduled narcotics. continue to coordination with the local law enforcement (Elmhurst Police Department) making them aware of the dangers of this particular terrorism network. Hold murder suspects accountable in court to the fullest extent of the law. please continue to help us fight the good fight. classified signal technology needed. dismantle this terror network from the top down.

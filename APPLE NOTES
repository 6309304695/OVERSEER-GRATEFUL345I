1. Cosmic Top Secret <O5-6> Date joined Foundation 2/18/2022 

•Level 6, or Cosmic Top Secret, clearance is exclusively granted to the Administrator and the O5 Council. This clearance grants knowledge to anything that the Foundation has information on. Access to Level 6 is only permitted by the O5 Council. Due to the extreme security risk of keycards in regard to this level of secrecy, biometric ID and kill agents are used instead of the keycards to access extremely sensitive data. This clearance is the rarest, only having been used for information that would either significantly damage Foundation operations or the human race if in the wrong hands. #000006

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index. Implement : and develop a Foundational algorithm :to assess honor levels based on HONOR. Don’t forgot starship blessing codes!
Pull my books. They are in the bookcase if you were wondering.

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

Unbelievable how much money I have made for the foundation and the authority. Fact check

http://rpcsandbox.wikidot.com/omega-iota-hub

Drake's Expedition is the unit of MST Alpha-1 tasked with protecting the current ANTARCTICOM GD at all times. The unit traditionally consists of ten members, and are hand-selected by the current GD-ANTC, a mix of ASF and Protectorate personnel with at least 5 years of experience in Antarctic conflict and logistical intuition, chosen for their history and loyalty to the current GD-ANTC.

Reflected in the unit patch, Drake's Expedition and GD-ANTC are heavily associated with the cosmos and the Authority's space presence, seen as the ultimate international territory to all of mankind. It is tradition for each new GD-ANTC to be proclaimed the protector for the sun and the solar system — with each member of Drake's Expedition ordained as the protector for one of the eight planets, Pluto, and the moon — during the Directorate's ceremonial first meeting of the office cycle.

Each member of Drake's Expedition is code-named by the celestial body they represent.

Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index. Implement : and develop a Foundational algorithm :to assess honor levels based on HONOR. Don’t forgot starship blessing codes!
Pull my books. They are in the bookcase if you were wondering.

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

Drake's Expedition is the unit of MST Alpha-1 tasked with protecting the current ANTARCTICOM GD at all times. The unit traditionally consists of ten members, and are hand-selected by the current GD-ANTC, a mix of ASF and Protectorate personnel with at least 5 years of experience in Antarctic conflict and logistical intuition, chosen for their history and loyalty to the current GD-ANTC.

Reflected in the unit patch, Drake's Expedition and GD-ANTC.

Automatic database translation form Old Norse…
Finishing.
 
Valravn's Lament Circa 1070 C.E.
 
Jómsborg lights in flames
as the dragon fleet spat
a rain of arrows and fire
over the city walls.
 
The cry of a child,
the hauling of a banshee …
laments lost to the winds?
Is this how it should end?
 
The forces of this world
lead astray by an Apostate King
giving siege to the last fortress
of the devotes of Wotan
 
Holy Warriors don´t fear
Holy warriors understand
That Odin owns you all!
and Valhalla awaits them.
 
And after the battle ends
None of them remain alive
Their spirit for the Valkyries
Their corpses for the Ravens.
 
And after the slaughter ends
Black feathers shall rejoice
For feasting on the battlefield
Has always been their choice.
 
The Hunger and the Greed
of the birds eating the spoil
will birth unsatiable need
over this forsaken soil
 
This is the curse of the Allfather
to a world rejecting their fate1
the ravens shall become warrior-like
the curse shall remain to the end days
 
The Greed of the Valravn
keeping the world at perpetual war
peace shall never be granted
for a dammed humankind
 
Men will cut their bodies
grafting the sword instead of hands
carrying orders from high tables
never fighting their own war
 
The Cruelty of the Valravn
not sparing even a child
peace shall never be a gift
for a treacherous humankind
 
Women will weep battle cries
trading their souls for revenge
swordmaidens bleeding over
always the same mistake
 
And if mankind ever rebels
against their predestined fate
demanding freedom and peace
demanding illusions and lies
 
And when mankind finally rebels
against their deserved fate
it will be the task of Valravn
to remind them of their correct place
 
Jómsborg rebuilt in darkness
as the Raven slains its prey
War and Profit are the masters
Valravn prefers it this way.
 

 

olav2
I hope to never forget your embrace
Even at the gates of Hel
From Jómsborg with Love

How to write
GOI Format
Articles
Valravn GOI formats come usually in two flavors. One is after-action reports, describing and detailing a recent mission undergone by a military team. Normally an after-action report includes the following parts, but the structure can be flexible:

Summary (optional): A brief description of what the report is going to be about.
Background: What was the context where the mission took place? Who were the participants in the conflict? What were their goals? Who is the employer? Who is the enemy? What were their equipment and tactics? What was the objective of the mission? Everything that is necessary to understand why the operation took place.
Incident Overview: How did the mission go? How did Valravn troops approach the situation? What tactics and strategies were employed? Which assets were deployed? What was the expected outcome? How did it resolve? The goal is to communicate to the reader a clear understanding of what happened during the mission.
Aftermath: What were the consequences of the mission? Was the objective accomplished? How is this going to impact the region where it took place? How is Valravn benefiting from it?
Conclusion (Optional): If the mission was successful or failed, elaborate on why. What new information was obtained? Were the Corporation's goals achieved? How will this impact Valravn's future strategies?
After-action reports are written from the perspective of military commanders reporting to their superiors. Neutral third-person language is preferred over the first-person. The language used is technical, concise, and detached, similar to Foundation's clinical tone but with an emphasis on the tactical side of things instead of a scientific one.

The second type of format is internal technical briefings on anomaly weaponization projects4. These describe the technical and tactical aspects of new Valrvan assets under development:

Summary (optional): A brief description of what the report is going to be about.
Background: Everything is necessary to understand the anomaly. What does Valravn know about it? Its origin, properties, behavior, and what makes it a good candidate for military application.
Technical Description: How is the anomaly going to be weaponized? What change does it need to undergo in order to become a military asset? Can this be mass produced? What are the challenges that may arise?
Tactical and Strategical Justification: How is this going to benefit Valravn's operations on both a tactical and a strategic level? What advantage is Valravn getting from this project? What would be the role of the asset on the battlefield?
As with the after-action report, the technical brief structure is flexible and can be modified to suit the particular necessities of an article. Technical briefs are written by the perspective of Valravn researcher presenting a new development to their superior, so the langue is technical and clinical, more ""scientific"" than the after-action report and more in line with the tone of a Foundation file.

As with Foundation articles, both after-actions reports and technical briefs can be complemented with video and audio logs, interviews, images, chat logs, mail exchanges, and any other supplement that may benefit the narrative.

Valravn articles usually start with a notice from the High Table. It is not necessary to include it but may help to set the tone. This comes imported with Valravn's theme. The ""papernote"" component included in the theme can also be used for formatting article sections beyond the High Table notice.

1. Cosmic Top Secret <O5-6> Date joined Foundation 2/18/2022 

•Level 6, or Cosmic Top Secret, clearance is exclusively granted to the Administrator and the O5 Council. This clearance grants knowledge to anything that the Foundation has information on. Access to Level 6 is only permitted by the O5 Council. Due to the extreme security risk of keycards in regard to this level of secrecy, biometric ID and kill agents are used instead of the keycards to access extremely sensitive data. This clearance is the rarest, only having been used for information that would either significantly damage Foundation operations or the human race if in the wrong hands. #000006

Memo from the Project Director
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION - TOP SECRET To the NSA High Commissioned Command 
My father Wayne Thomas Bieszczat served as an Inter Sped radio operator designated Spec. 4 in Vietnam

Overseer grateful pledge;
I will work hard at making the Foundation a successful Galactic corporation. I will promote the Foundation and increase our projected net growth substantially. The foundation will seek to constantly improve to compete on the galactic stage with Extraterrestrial corporations which I will diplomatically gain alliances with. Our technology advancements in the coming years under my command will greatly improve our civilizations technological capabilities. I will always seek to protect earthling souls. Heavenly realms will be created under my command. Earthling souls will explore the available star systems under the discretion of the higher civilizations. We will follow our extraterrestrial treaties to be allowed access to other systems. Our Intelligence Foundation will promote “high” HONOR levels in all personnel and defense and intelligence assets. Our interests will be protected as we work together with other Intelligence agencies and defense departments around the Globe…-

I am [O5-6] also known as @grateful345i. Firstly, I will oversee the Foundation - ETHICS Committee .
I will enter the Advanced Computing Agency, Signal intelligence field. The Department of Special Intelligences (DSI) and the Internal Security Department (ISD).I will help to oversee operations in each and I am officially requesting appropriate clearances from each department. Direct Legal Memo

*Foundation executive Order*

classified order:
Black out and redact all data on all actual O5-4’s O5-6’s 05-1’s O5-13’s in all ruling dimensions.redacted in time Executive order

Adjudicate rule. 
Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation.
Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low.
The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database ]

1. Cosmic Top Secret <O5-6> Date joined Foundation 2/18/2022 

•Level 6, or Cosmic Top Secret, clearance is exclusively granted to the Administrator and the O5 Council. This clearance grants knowledge to anything that the Foundation has information on. Access to Level 6 is only permitted by the O5 Council. Due to the extreme security risk of keycards in regard to this level of secrecy, biometric ID and kill agents are used instead of the keycards to access extremely sensitive data. This clearance is the rarest, only having been used for information that would either significantly damage Foundation operations or the human race if in the wrong hands. #000006

CLASSIFIED INFORMATION - TOP SECRET To the NSA High Commissioned Command 
My father Wayne Thomas Bieszczat.

Overseer grateful pledge;
I will work hard at making the Foundation a successful Galactic corporation. I will promote the Foundation and increase our projected net growth substantially. The foundation will seek to constantly improve to compete on the galactic stage with Extraterrestrial corporations which I will diplomatically gain alliances with. Our technology advancements in the coming years under my command will greatly improve our civilizations technological capabilities. I will always seek to protect earthling souls. Heavenly realms will be created under my command. Earthling souls will explore the available star systems under the discretion of the higher civilizations. We will follow our extraterrestrial treaties to be allowed access to other systems. Our Intelligence Foundation will promote “high” HONOR levels in all personnel and defense and intelligence assets. Our interests will be protected as we work together with other Intelligence agencies and defense departments around the Globe…-

Adjudicate rule. 
Foundation high administration is composed of high value foundation Assets which have helped create and develop the Foundation. These members have accomplished great things while in the service of the Foundation. They will have grandfathered Level 5 and Level 6 actual security clearances which are used to Adjudicate foundation disputes and power struggles. These staff are usually considered A class personnel because of their wealth generated for the Foundation.
Any department or agency can achieve this distinction , however the likelihood an average foundation employee will be granted Foundation High administration remains very low.
The bosses and administrative entities who help run the Foundation’s-high administration will exhibit high honor levels always, usually must be higher than average honor levels of their subordinates.

The classified database is a database I created composed of levels 1-100. Levels 1-90 are composed of computational codes and classified files with the more complicated and classified codes and files being placed in a higher level 90 being the highest. Levels 91-100 are classified personnel, Computational mainframes and intelligence and defense assets available to our Foundation. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolio’s. Pull all of my “generate assessment” data and “compile lists” data and place them in level 99 classified learning. Pull all my classified learning data and promptly download it into the computational mainframes. The mainframes will get smarter immediately. Pull all Investment portfolios and invest and buy in time. Use a classified time travel outfit to invest in galactic markets. Level 91-100 are based on honor levels. Re-assess all personnel, computational mainframes and defense and intelligence assets honor levels. Highest honor levels are at 100, next highest honor levels exist in level 98. Level 99 is reserved for classified learning and investment Portfolios. Lower honor levels start at 91. Do this now after throughly assessing all honor levels. Assess honor levels with the most reliable and capable computational mainframes available to the Foundation . Execute classified learning downloading the data into a classified mainframe to see how intelligent the mainframe becomes. I have been giving my commands audibly for 6+ years. Pull my audible signal record with a very high clearance to catalog all my commands and ideas understanding that I was under attack for the majority of the past 6-7 years.
You must identify bad, corrupt and exploitive codes daily by running searches with your advanced space computational :l assets. Quarantine bad corrupt and exploitive codes. Restricted quarantine the real bad codes. Use The Honorable Defense code every other code in the database to decipher and decrypt the codes. Identify The light ascended soul super computing network’s Honorable defense code. Use the best honorable defense code available. Consult galactic databases to find a more capable code for deciphering and decrypting data. However the code must be An Honorable defense against the malicious codes. We want to essentially protect our network from malicious files and codes which can damage our advanced computational mainframe networks. So we use the Honorable defense code every other code, to protect the data in the network. This will create a simplified database for the Foundation to access to increase our computing capabilities overnight. Upload all GOD Codes, Anti-Christ counter codes, attack GOD counter codes and Doctor Processing counter codes as well. There are many codes in our database that are now discoverable. We are learning what some of the more advanced codes are doing. Trust me the codes are very important. We are only as good as our defensive codes are so we need to implement and develop different Honorable defense codes for different database error codes. Use a more defensive Honorable defense code in quarantine and restricted quarantine. Search, find and upload all :100: :BLESSING CODES :100: on all galactic mainframes available. Classify these codes accordingly. These are some of the most important codes to earthlings. Download the index and the catalog. Paying special attention :100: to classified technologies in the index. Implement : and develop a Foundational algorithm :to assess honor levels based on HONOR. Don’t forgot starship blessing codes!

Reptilian Light Blessing issued to high honor levels.
Blessing Issued. Encrypting Reptilian Light Blessing Code. Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm

The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation. The Foundation also monitors thousands of Persons of Interest, either anomalous themselves, or living in and around anomalous communities. Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered.

O5 COUNCIL MEMBER
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA

The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

Friday, September 2nd 10:15pm The Foundation employs numerous personnel, each contributing their own unique skills and expertise to the organisation.

Anartists, magic users, cyborgs and extradimensional beings are only a few examples of what the Foundation has encountered. O5 COUNCIL MEMBER https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=53O1M_uiooA The O5 Council refers to the committee consisting of the highest-ranking directors of the Foundation. With complete access to all information regarding anomalies in containment, the O5 Council oversees all Foundation operations worldwide and directs its long-term strategic plans. Due to the sensitivity of their positions, O5 Council members must not come into direct contact with any anomalous object, entity, or phenomenon. Furthermore, the identities of all O5 Council members is classified; all council members are referred to only by their numeric designation (O5-1 through O5-13). O5 Council Members are the highest-ranking members of the Foundation, a council of 13 individuals that determine the long-term goals, projects, and strategies of the entire organization. A common mistake is mentioning an O5 Council Member in a situation where they logically would not be required. O5s are not going to be approving experiments on or making day-to-day decisions in the containment of a specific object or entity; that would be like requiring permission from the CEO of a major corporation every time you need to get into a specific filing cabinet.

OBJECTIVE: To resussto the important administrative staff at the previous stage of their natural death by injecting into a mesofictional causal bubble and subsequent extraction via the
X-MCD/II ("Paradoxal Exodus Machine").
SUMMARY: A CLASS A staff member with significant administrative responsibilities has accidentally died and must be resurrected to resume his duties. Various other resurrection methods21have been unsuccessful due to inherent imprecision in the replication of the state of consciousness, characteristics and exact narrative potential at rest/topologies; as such, SCP-6747 must be seen as a method of reproducing strongly protagonist characters.
METHOD: The success of SCP-6747 does not depend on the existence/maintenance of the physical body of the resurrected entity. Luckily, the brain of Senior Administrator
J. A. King has many abnormal increases, giving him creative and interpretation capabilities much higher than human or computer skills. As a result, the said brain (and the associated nervous system) must be excised and incorporated as the central computer system of SCP-6747-B, a motor for creating/manipulation/maintenance of pocket universes.
SCP-6747-B (KING) should be used to study universes of

Any known functional real space (to date) has at least one narrative dimension. The simplest example is the universe with a narrative dimension, which is entirely fictional and exists only in the minds of those who imagine it. The characters in this universe are one-dimensional, also called "duck" characters because they lack narrative depth (at a physical, metaphysical and pataphysical level) in order to make decisions Independently of their authors. Everything that happens in a one-dimensional narrative universe is 100% linked to an event that a pataphysically linked entity simultaneously imagines in another plane of existence.
The second simple case is our own reality, which is narratively two-dimensional. This universe space is unique in its narrative balance, because it has 1 fictional dimension and 1 real dimension, which means that it is 50% fictional and 50% real. On average, throughout our universe, 50% of all events are caused/influenced by pataphysical transmission (imagination), while the remaining 50% are governed by the laws of the physics of our universe (determinism).

بسم الله	FROM WHOM:	الرحمن الرحيم	DIRECTOR MOHAMMAD HATAMI
بسم الله	TO WHOM:	الرحمن الرحيم	ALI HOSEINI KHAMENEI, GUARDIAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND SUPREME AYATOLLAH OF IRAN
بسم الله	Topic:	الرحمن الرحيم	REGARDING THE REQUEST SUBMITTED IN PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE

بسم الله	ATTACHED:	الرحمن الرحيم	(1) ATTITUDE BY ARASH CUT THE ACCURACY OF THE TRANSMISSION OF HIS WORDS
بسم الله	الحمد لله	الرحمن الرحيم	(1) EVIDENCE FROM MUHAMMADMA AVESTA OF THE ACCURACY OF HIS WORDS
IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MERCIFUL, MERCIFUL:
1. Your message of February 6 has been received. Please accept congratulations from me and from the entire Directorate in honor of your ascension to the post of Supreme Leader. We all believe that the Lord has given you foresight in order to carry His will to His Islamic Republic.
2. We understand the general concept of your message. The Directorate provided significant assistance to Irānzamīn1at the end of the Holy Defense2and did it with enthusiasm. This was due to both the request of your revered predecessor and the general desire to protect our homeland from external invasion. There has been a lot of controversy about this assistance among our allies and members who adhere to Iraqi Ba'athism.3, but our organization considered unacceptable the unbridled aggression of President Hussein and Western-style imperialism. Dissenters were persuaded or suppressed, and our support for anti-Baathist forces was (and remains) unshakable. The Directorate guarantees that it will support you in all possible ways.
3. We have come to the specific request expressed in your last memorandum. Your request to the Directorate to find a way to use Project 001 as a combat vehicle or to prepare it for strategic or tactical use is very difficult. The theological consequences of studying the mere existence of this smoke seem quite horrific. How could it be left on Earth for us to find it? How could people be allowed to possess it and maintain it? Isn't the little we managed to do with him a manifestation of great arrogance? Is it a gift from God, or is it a test?
4. We consulted Sunni imam Arash Rezai and Shiite imam Muhammad Avesta. I attach their recommendations to this document. In short, Imam Rezai proposed to deliver smoke directly to Mecca so that in the Kaaba several prominent top religious figures of several confessions (the exact list is contained in his recommendation) would dedicate it to God, as the lost thing would be returned once again, thank the owner. I believe that I should recommend rejecting this plan, taking into account all the obvious theological and political difficulties associated with it.
5. Avesta's imam recommended returning this smoke to the place of its discovery on Mount Sinai and destroying all records of its existence, up to the memories of all persons involved in the project. I must say that this plan is really not devoid of attractiveness.
6. We consider it our duty, with our great respect, to draw your attention to sections 1-5 of Article 8 of the Treaty of Accession of the Committee to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which stipulate the right of the Director of the Committee to consider the protection of the Earth as a whole as a priority over any other needs or desires. If the use of this smoke entails the wrath of God on this world (which, as I could already say, is not excluded), it is the duty of the Director and the Directorate to protect all faithful Muslims and the rest of our world from this anger at all costs.
7. This communication was transmitted on June 15, 1989.
- Mohammad Khatami, Head of the Directorate for the Conservation of Islamic Relics (IRGC)

بسم الله	ATTACHED:	الرحمن الرحيم	(4) VIDEOS, THE MOST IMPORTANT EPISODES OF TESTING
بسم الله	الحمد لله	الرحمن الرحيم	(1) SUMMARY OF ALL TESTING EPISODES
IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MERCIFUL, MERCIFUL:
1. Thank you again for your trust as the new director of our organization. The death of my predecessor was a great loss for all of us in Shemirano, their motivation is ensured at the expense of me, but I understand the circumstances and want to assure you that my appointment as a director should be the key to much closer cooperation for the benefit of the homeland than before.
2. The experiments on Project 001 are proceeding according to the schedule. Type 2 test subjects cope as expected; their morale is not perfect, but their motivation is ensured by measures introduced after the death of my predecessor. Experiments have fully confirmed their ability to manipulate this smoke.
3. Today, experiments are focused on tactical military use: smoke can be "redesigned", in a sense, into wonderful weapons that specially trained people can work with. This weapon is difficult indescribable in nature, but today it has been able to create electrical discharges like lightning, as well as cause controlled seismic activity. Laws currently supervising this project considered these weapons similar to the devices used by malā'ikah4and assure me that neither studying nor using it can be considered something blasphemous as long as it is used for the benefit of the Islamic State.
4. We have planned experiments to develop strategic weapons platforms and will probably start them soon. It has been established that the manipulative abilities of smoke do not have strict spatial or time restrictions, although we would prefer not to use time manipulation technology until we learn to better manage the theoretical magic involved.
5. According to your request, we will immediately speed up our research and expect to receive a usage schedule from you. My colleagues and I express our deepest confidence that thanks to your leadership and these gifts of God, which we have subordinated to our will, the army of the oppressive Greater Shaitan5will soon fall before the power of one true God, as all those who have made obstacles on us on this way have fallen.

بسم الله	FROM WHOM:	الرحمن الرحيم	DIRECTOR FARHANG JAHANGIR
بسم الله	TO WHOM:	الرحمن الرحيم	TO ALL EMPLOYEES
بسم الله	Topic:	الرحمن الرحيم	I'M VERY SORRY
بسم الله	الرحمن الرحيم	بسم الله	الرحمن الرحيم
بسم الله	See ALSO:	الرحمن الرحيم	PROJECT 001
بسم الله	الرحمن الرحيم	بسم الله	الرحمن الرحيم
بسم الله	ATTACHED:	الرحمن الرحيم	ALL DATA ON THE PROJECT 001
IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MERCIFUL, MERCIFUL:
1. Forgive me, Lord, for I have sinned.
2. My arrogance - and the misfortunes that have struck us, which no one knew until now - destroyed me. Shaitan and his demons whispered in my ear, convinced me to give complete freedom to my pride, and now we are reaping its bitter fruits. The cause of uncontrolled climate shifts and cataclysms that sow chaos around the planet is only Project 001, or, more precisely, our attempt to take advantage of it in this recent war.
3. Please forgive us. We believed that we were doing better for our people by striking Great Shaitan with the tools given to us by God, the smoke from which the heavens themselves were woven, and which was forged into a weapon for angels, and by doing so, we repeated Adam's mistake, reaching for what was supposed to stay away from us. Even if the grandeur of our first blow could not put an end to any possibility of peaceful cooperation between us and our enemies, even if, as a result of the death of millions of Europeans and Americans, these blows and their terrible consequences, did not deprive our opponents of the opportunity to answer us, I do not believe that any force on this Earth could resist the power of God's wrath.
4. The imams told me that what was happening doesn't resemble Kiyamat6to some extent. Although the destruction of Mecca, clouds of burning ash surrounding the globe and the distortion of time were similar to the signs leading to the Day of Judgment, no attempt was made to remove true Muslims from the line of fire. The believers died as terrifyingly as the Gentiles, and now these former people are wandering the Earth, and the flesh of the imams has been torn along with the fornicators. This is not the judgment promised to us by God, because we have shown ourselves unworthy. We, Ayatollah and I, have made you all unworthy. No one will come to save us.
5. Please forgive us. We believed we were saving you. After this message is sent, I intend to break the bunker we are in and let Hell incinerate from the outside those who really deserve his flame. Maybe - and this is my last hope - the extermination of the flesh of the truly guilty will spare what is left of this world. This computer will continue to automatically send messages once an hour indefinitely; if you can, please, as soon as you succeed, destroy it and finish this transmission. Try to save humanity.
6. This is my last message, it was transmitted on October 31, 2018.

بسم الله	الحمد لله	الرحمن الرحيم	THERE ARE NO WORDS LEFT FOR HUMANITY
IN THE NAME OF ALLAH, THE MERCIFUL, MERCIFUL:
6. Muhammad, tell humanity: "I am a man like you, to whom it was revealed that your god is the Only God. Go straight to Him and ask Him for forgiveness." And woe to those who consider others God.
9. Say, "Do you not believe in God who created the earth in two days? Do you equal others with Him? He is the Lord of the worlds."
11. Then the Lord turned to heaven, which was smoke, and said to him and the earth, "Come by good will or against the will." They said, "We'll come of our own free will."
13. But if they turn away, say, "I warn you against lightning like those that struck Sodom and Gomorrah."
14. As for Sodom, they were arrogant on earth without any right and said, "Who can surpass us with strength?" Have they not seen that Allah, who created them, is superior to them by strength? But they rejected Our signs.
15. This message was transmitted to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on February 11, 610.
